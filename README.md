# Graphics_and_Multimedia
My lab materials for computer graphics and multimedia are stored in this repository. The files consist of multimedia components that I produced for my coursework, including source code, output photos, and other assets.

Each lab file offers a brief explanation of the project's goal and functioning and matches to a particular Computer Graphics or Multimedia topic or application. The files are arranged according to lab sessions and cover a variety of subjects, such as image processing, 2D and 3D graphics, and multimedia design.

Anyone interested in learning more about computer graphics and multimedia can benefit greatly from these lab files. They give students, enthusiasts, and professionals alike practical experience in building and executing multimedia programmes.
